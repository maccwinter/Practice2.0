#I believe I have finally figured out how to set up version control
#with GitHub and successfully commit and push my changes. It has taken me
#several hours, but it feels good to have figured it out. I am not done for 
#the day with my work. Tomorrow I will begin again. 
#I am now looking into a warning that said "adding ip address to list of known
#hosts" to see if it always gives that warning. Might have to figure that out.
